Privacy Badger for Android is a project that aims at extablishing online privacy by blocking third party trackers on Android device. 
This is an Android Application that aims at intercepting the traffic from android device and detect URLs that appear to track the user while browsing.

*PLEASE SEE: THE PROJECT IS WORK IN PROGRESS*

It is an open source project under GNU General Public License.

For developers:
To build this on your system, you need Android Studio, Java JDK.
Presently, the application creates a proxy server that runs as a service on the device where all the outgoing url requests are intercepted. We are in a state of transitioning the logic by using AndroidVpnService.

Code documentation coming soon.
